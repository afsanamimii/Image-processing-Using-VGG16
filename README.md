# Image-processing-Using-VGG16

In this Code i have trained my model using VGG16. My dataset consists of total 2595 images of cats and dogs. I got around 96% training accuracy and 91% validation accuracy using this VGG16 model.

Implementation and details of this code is explained in my you tube channel: https://youtu.be/DC4E24MQoNQ
